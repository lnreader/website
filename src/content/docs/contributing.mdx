# Contributing to LNReader

Contributions to **LNReader** are welcome and greatly appreciated! Follow this guide to prepare your workstation and ship your first change.

## Setting up your environment

After forking the repository to your GitHub account or organization, make sure your machine meets these requirements:

- **Node.js version 18 or newer**. For version management, we recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
- **Java SDK version 15 or newer**. You can optionally manage versions with [`jenv`](https://www.jenv.be/).
- **Android SDK**. Download the tooling from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

## Quick start steps

1. Clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/lnreader.git
   ```

2. Step into the repository:

   ```bash
   cd lnreader
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Build the APK:

   ```bash
   npm run buildRelease
   ```

## Developing on Android

You will need an Android device or emulator connected to your computer and an IDE such as VS Code.

- **ADB (Android Debug Bridge)**: Install via the [Android Developer site](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb).
- **IDE of your choice**: Any editor with React Native tooling works well.

### Development steps

1. Verify your Android device or emulator is connected:

   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

2. Start Metro for development:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. Launch the app on Android in a new terminal:

   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

To reload the app after making code changes, save your files and press `r` in the Metro terminal. The Android device or emulator reloads shortly after.

## Style and linting

This codebase enforces linting rules with [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). Install an ESLint plugin for your editor to receive live feedback, or run the lint script manually:

```bash
npm run lint
```
