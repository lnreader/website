# Contributing to LNReader

LNReader thrives on community contributions. Whether you are fixing a typo, adding a plugin feature, or polishing the reader experience, this guide outlines the same workflow our core maintainers follow.

## Before You Start

Make sure your workstation can build and run the Android app:

- **Node.js 18+** (use [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) if you juggle versions)
- **Java 15+** (optionally managed with [`jenv`](https://www.jenv.be/))
- **Android SDK & platform tools** from [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Set Up Your Fork

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/lnreader.git
   cd lnreader
   npm install
   ```

3. Verify you can produce a release build (this also validates your toolchain):

   ```bash
   npm run buildRelease
   ```

If the Gradle build fails, confirm the Android SDK path and Java version are set correctly.

## Run LNReader Locally

1. Connect an Android device (with USB debugging) or start an emulator.
2. Confirm the device is visible to ADB:

   ```bash
   adb devices
   ```

3. Start the Metro bundler:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. In another terminal, install and launch the app:

   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```

Metro supports fast refresh—save a file, then press `r` in the Metro window if you need a manual reload.

## Coding Workflow

- Create feature branches off the latest `main`.
- Keep pull requests focused and include screenshots or recordings for UI changes.
- Reference related GitHub issues in commit messages and PR descriptions.

## Checks and Standards

- **Linting**: Run ESLint locally before opening a PR.

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Formatting**: Follow the existing TypeScript and React Native conventions. Configure your editor with Prettier/ESLint integration for consistent formatting.
- **CI expectations**: Ensure your branch builds and lint checks pass; CI must be green before merge.

## Where to Help

- **Bug fixes**: Look for issues labelled `bug` or `help wanted` in GitHub.
- **Plugins & sources**: Improve existing plugins or propose new ones in the [`lnreader-sources`](https://github.com/LNReader/lnreader-sources) repository.
- **Documentation**: Refine guides like this one to make onboarding easier for the next contributor.

## Localization

We translate LNReader via [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lnreader). Create a free account, choose your language, and contribute strings directly in the browser—no development setup required. The project dashboard shows live translation coverage for every locale.
