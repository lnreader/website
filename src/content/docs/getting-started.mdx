# Getting started with LNReader

Thanks for downloading LNReader! This guide walks through installing the Android app, adding your first source, and managing the reader experience.

## 1. Install the latest APK

1. Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/LNReader/lnreader/releases) on your device or desktop.
2. Download the `app-release.apk` artifact from the most recent stable release.
3. On Android, open the file and allow installs from unknown sources when prompted.
4. After installation, launch **LNReader** from your app drawer.

> Tip: Want to test unreleased features? Pull the most recent build from the **Actions** tab and install the generated artifact instead.

## 2. Add sources

LNReader ships with a minimal catalogue so you can choose what to install.

1. Open the side drawer and tap **Plugins**.
2. Browse categories or use search to find a light novel provider.
3. Tap **Install** to add the extension. Repeat for as many as you’d like.
4. Access installed catalogues from the **Browse** tab. Each source has its own filters and language settings.

Need a source that’s missing? Create a request in the [`lnreader-sources` repository](https://github.com/LNReader/lnreader-sources/issues).

## 3. Build your library

1. Tap a novel from the catalogue, then press **Add to library**.
2. Chapters can be downloaded in bulk or on demand. Long-press to multi-select, then choose **Download**.
3. Organize with categories like _Ongoing_, _Completed_, or custom tags.
4. Enable library updates to keep track of new chapters across all sources.

## 4. Customize the reader

- Choose from multiple reader themes or build your own color palette.
- Adjust font, text size, and line height per source or globally.
- Toggle immersive mode, scroll direction, and reading progress indicators.
- Sync reading positions to the cloud with your preferred backup solution.

## 5. Stay in sync

- **Backups**: Export your library, categories, and history from **Settings → Backup & Restore**.
- **Discord**: Join the [LNReader community](https://discord.gg/u2pTuQ8) for support, news, and extension updates.
- **GitHub**: Star the repository, follow the roadmap, and contribute fixes or translations.

You’re all set—happy reading!
