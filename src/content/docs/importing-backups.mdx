# Importing backups

Migrating devices or coming from Tachiyomi? LNReader supports several backup formats to restore your library and reading progress.

## Supported backup formats

- **LNReader JSON**: The native format produced by `Settings → Backup & Restore → Create backup`.
- **Tachiyomi/TachiyomiSY**: Drop-in compatible `.json` exports translate categories, chapters, and history.
- **Mihon**: Restores library entries; some custom reader configurations may need manual tweaks.

## Export from your old device

1. Open your previous reader app.
2. Navigate to the backup/export option and generate a full backup including categories and history.
3. Transfer the resulting file to your new device via cloud storage, USB, or ADB.

## Restore in LNReader

1. Open **Settings → Backup & Restore → Restore backup**.
2. Pick the exported backup file (`.json` or `.proto`).
3. Confirm the import summary. Large libraries can take a few minutes.
4. Restart the app to ensure the library rebuilds with fresh metadata.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing covers or metadata

- Tap the novel → **Refresh metadata** to fetch updated titles and descriptions.
- Run **Library → Update library** to refresh everything in bulk.

### Source not installed

- If chapters show as unknown, install the matching extension from the **Plugins** screen.
- For private/self-hosted sources, add custom connectors via the `lnreader-sources` instructions.

### Failed imports

- Verify the backup is complete and not truncated (some file managers split large files).
- Check Logcat or `adb logcat` for parse errors if you’re debugging locally.

## Next steps

- Configure automatic scheduled backups to your preferred cloud provider.
- Enable reader sync tools for chapter tracking.
- Contribute migration scripts or automation tips in the community docs.
