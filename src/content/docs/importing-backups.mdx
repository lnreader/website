# Importing backups

Migrating devices or coming from Tachiyomi? LNReader supports several backup formats to restore your library and reading progress.

## Supported backup formats

- **LNReader JSON**: The native format produced by `Settings → Backup & Restore → Create backup`.

## Export from your old device

1. Open your previous reader app.
2. Navigate to the backup/export option and generate a full backup including categories and history.
3. Transfer the resulting file to your new device via cloud storage, USB, or ADB.

## Restore in LNReader

1. Open **Settings → Backup & Restore → Restore backup**.
2. Pick the exported backup file (`.json`).
3. Confirm the import summary. Large libraries can take a few minutes.
4. Restart the app to ensure the library rebuilds with fresh metadata.
