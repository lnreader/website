# Frequently asked questions

## Is LNReader available on iOS or desktop?

Not yet. LNReader focuses on Android, but the codebase is open source—community members can fork it for other platforms.

## How do I request a new source?

Open an issue in the [`lnreader-sources`](https://github.com/LNReader/lnreader-sources/issues) repository. Include the website URL, language, and any access requirements.

## Can I use my Tachiyomi backups?

Yes. Export a `.json` backup from Tachiyomi (or forks like TachiyomiSY). Then use **Settings → Backup & Restore → Restore backup** in LNReader to import.

## Does the app collect analytics?

No. LNReader does not collect telemetry or serve ads. All data stays on your device unless you explicitly opt in to external sync services.

## Do I need root access?

No root required. LNReader works on any modern Android phone or tablet running Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or newer.
