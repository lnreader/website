# General

### Is LNReader available on iOS or desktop?

Not yet. LNReader is currently focused on Android, but the project is open source—anyone can fork it and explore other platforms.

### How do I request a new plugin?

Open an issue in the [`lnreader-sources`](https://github.com/LNReader/lnreader-sources/issues) repository. Share the website URL, preferred language, and any login or region requirements so plugin authors have the full context.

### Does the app collect analytics?

No. LNReader ships without telemetry, trackers, or ads. Everything stays on your device unless you enable an external backup or sync integration.

### Do I need root access?

No. LNReader runs on standard Android devices and tablets as long as they’re on Android 6.0 (Marshmallow) or newer.
